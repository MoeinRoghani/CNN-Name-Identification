Description: In this project, our goal is to create a model that can predict a person's name and their age, 
based on their image using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which we have implemented for each. 

Datasets used for training:
- lfw: The data set contains more than 13,000 images of faces (5749 people) collected from the web

- Names100: Contains 80,000 unconstrained human face images, including 100 popular names and 800 images per name
